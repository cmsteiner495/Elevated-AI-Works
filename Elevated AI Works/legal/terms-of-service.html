      </p>
      <p class="text-slate-300 mt-4">
        These Terms of Service (“Terms”) describe how Elevated AI Works (“we,” “us,” or “our”) works with clients and
        how projects are generally handled. Because every project is unique, specific details in your proposal, quote,
        or invoice may supplement or modify these Terms.
      </p>
      <p class="text-xs text-slate-400 mt-2">
        These Terms are not legal advice. If you have questions about your rights or obligations, please talk with a qualified attorney.
      </p>
    </header>

    <section class="space-y-4 text-slate-300">
      <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold text-brandRed">1. Working Together</h2>
      <p>
        A project typically starts with a conversation about your goals, followed by a quote or proposal outlining
        the expected scope, pricing, and timeline. Once you confirm that you’d like to proceed (and, when required,
        pay any initial deposit), the project is considered active.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold text-brandRed">2. Scope, Changes &amp; Additional Work</h2>
      <p>
        The scope of work is based on what’s described in your quote, proposal, or email agreement. If you request
        changes that go beyond the original scope—such as extra pages, new features, or major redesigns—those may be treated
        as additional work and quoted separately.
      </p>
      <p>
        To keep things clear, scope changes are usually confirmed in writing (for example, via email), along with any
        impact on cost or timeline.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold text-brandRed">3. Pricing, Invoices &amp; Payment</h2>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1">
        <li>Project pricing is typically fixed based on the agreed scope, unless otherwise noted.</li>
        <li>For certain projects, a deposit may be required before work begins.</li>
        <li>Remaining balances are generally due upon delivery of final files or completion of agreed milestones.</li>
        <li>
          Payment details, due dates, and accepted payment methods will be listed on your invoice or in your project
          communication.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Late or significantly delayed payments may pause ongoing work until the account is brought up to date.
        Please see the Refund &amp; Revision Policy for more details on deposits, cancellations, and refunds.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold text-brandRed">4. Revisions &amp; Approvals</h2>
      <p>
        Most projects include a certain number of revision rounds for key deliverables (for example, logo concepts, page
        layouts, or document templates). Revisions are meant for adjustments and refinements—not repeated restarts of the
        entire project.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before final delivery or launch, you will have a chance to review and approve the work. Once you approve a
        deliverable and it is handed off or published, further changes may be treated as new work.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold text-brandRed">5. Files, Licenses &amp; Ownership</h2>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1">
        <li>
          After full payment is received, you generally receive the rights to use the final deliverables for the purposes
          described in your project (for example, branding your business, running your website, or using your documents).
        </li>
        <li>
          Elevated AI Works may retain the right to display non-sensitive project work in a private or public portfolio,
          unless you request otherwise in writing before the project starts or where confidentiality is required.
        </li>
        <li>
          Any third-party assets (such as fonts, stock photos, or icons) may be subject to their own licenses and usage
          restrictions. You are responsible for following those third-party terms if you request or use those assets.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold text-brandRed">6. Use of AI &amp; Technology</h2>
      <p>
        AI tools and other software may be used to help generate ideas, drafts, or variations as part of the creative
        process. Human review and judgment are used to refine this material into the final deliverables.
      </p>
      <p>
        While reasonable care is taken to ensure quality and originality, AI tools can sometimes produce unexpected or
        similar outputs. If you have specific concerns about how AI is used on your project, please raise them early so we
        can adjust the approach where possible.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold text-brandRed">7. Your Responsibilities</h2>
      <p>
        To keep projects running smoothly, you agree to:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1">
        <li>Provide accurate information about your business, goals, and requirements.</li>
        <li>Supply any necessary content (such as logos, copy, or images) that you have the rights to use.</li>
        <li>Respond to questions and review requests within a reasonable timeframe.</li>
        <li>Let us know as early as possible if your priorities or timelines change.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold text-brandRed">8. Timelines &amp; Delays</h2>
      <p>
        Estimated timelines are based on both sides staying reasonably responsive and providing information when needed.
        Delays in feedback, approvals, or content may push back delivery dates.
      </p>
      <p>
        If unexpected circumstances arise on either side, the timeline can be adjusted by mutual agreement. The goal is to
        keep communication open and realistic.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold text-brandRed">9. Disclaimers &amp; Limits of Liability</h2>
      <p>
        Designs, websites, tools, and documents are created to be helpful and practical, but specific outcomes (such as
        increased sales, traffic, or engagement) cannot be guaranteed. Many factors are outside the control of Elevated AI Works.
      </p>
      <p>
        To the fullest extent allowed by law, Elevated AI Works is not liable for indirect, incidental, or consequential
        damages arising from your use of the deliverables or this website. If liability is ever found, it is limited to the
        amount you paid for the specific project connected to the claim.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold text-brandRed">10. Termination</h2>
      <p>
        Either party may end a project if it no longer makes sense to continue. If you decide to end a project early,
        you may be responsible for paying for work performed up to the termination date, as described in the Refund &amp;
        Revision Policy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Elevated AI Works may also end a project in rare situations, such as non-payment, repeated lack of response, or
        significant ethical concerns.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold text-brandRed">11. Changes to These Terms</h2>
      <p>
        These Terms may be updated occasionally to reflect changes in how work is handled or to clarify language. The
        “Last updated” date at the top of this page shows the current version. For ongoing projects, any material changes
        will be communicated or agreed to as appropriate.
