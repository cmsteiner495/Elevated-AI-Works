          You must be at least 18 years old and able to enter into a legally binding agreement to use our Services.
          By using the Services, you represent and warrant that you meet these requirements.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-4">3. Client Information &amp; Communication</h2>
        <p>
          You may be asked to provide information such as your name, contact details, and project requirements. You agree
          that any information you provide is accurate and up to date, and you consent to us contacting you regarding your
          project and related services.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-4">4. Proposals, Scope &amp; Approvals</h2>
        <p>
          Before starting a project, we may provide a proposal or quote outlining scope, timeline, and fees. Once you approve
          the proposal (including by written acceptance, email confirmation, or payment), the scope is considered agreed upon.
          Changes to the scope may result in additional fees and adjusted timelines.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-4">5. Payments</h2>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1">
          <li>Payment terms are described in your proposal, invoice, or service agreement.</li>
          <li>Unless otherwise specified, payment is due upon receipt of invoice.</li>
          <li>We may pause work or withhold final deliverables until payment is received in full.</li>

        <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-4">6. Revisions</h2>
        <p>
          Projects typically include a defined number of revision rounds, outlined in your proposal. Additional revisions
          beyond what is included may incur extra fees at our current hourly or per-revision rate.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-4">7. Intellectual Property</h2>
        <h3 class="font-semibold mt-2">7.1 Ownership After Payment</h3>
        <p>
          After full payment is received for a project, you receive a license to use the final, approved deliverables for
          your own business purposes (for example, using a logo in your branding or using a website design on your domain).
        </p>
        <h3 class="font-semibold mt-2">7.2 Our Rights</h3>

        </ul>

        <h3 class="font-semibold mt-2">7.3 Third-Party &amp; AI Tools</h3>
        <p>
          Our Services may incorporate third-party assets (e.g., fonts, stock images) and AI tools, which may be subject
          to separate license terms. We make commercially reasonable efforts to use appropriate licenses, and you agree to
          comply with any license terms communicated to you.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-4">8. AI-Generated Content &amp; No Professional Advice</h2>
        <p>
          Some content we provide may be created or assisted by artificial intelligence (“AI”). AI-generated content:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1">

          <li>Use deliverables in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-4">10. Cancellations &amp; Refunds</h2>
        <p>
          Our cancellation and refund practices are described in our
          <a href="refund-policy.html" class="text-brandRed hover:underline">Refund &amp; Cancellation Policy</a>,
          which is incorporated into these Terms by reference.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-4">11. Disclaimers</h2>
        <p>
          To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Services and all deliverables are provided “as is” and “as available,”

          or goodwill arising from or related to your use of the Services.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our total liability for any claim related to the Services is limited to the amount you paid for the specific
