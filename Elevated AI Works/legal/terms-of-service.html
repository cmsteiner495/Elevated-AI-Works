      <p>
        These Terms of Service (“Terms”) describe the conditions under which Elevated AI Works (“we,” “us,” or “our”)
        provides design, consulting, and related digital services (the “Services”). By engaging with Elevated AI Works,
        you (“Client” or “you”) agree to these Terms.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold text-brandRed">1. Scope of Work</h2>
      <p>
        The specific scope, deliverables, timeline, and pricing for each project will be outlined in written form
        (such as an email summary, proposal, or quote). Only what is explicitly listed in that agreement is included in
        the project scope.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold text-brandRed">2. Communication & Approvals</h2>
      <p>
        Most communication will occur via email or other written channels. You agree to provide timely feedback and approvals
        so the project can move forward. Delays in feedback may extend project timelines.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold text-brandRed">3. Revisions</h2>
      <p>
        Unless otherwise stated in your project summary, each major deliverable includes a limited number of revision rounds.
        Revisions are intended for reasonable tweaks, not full redesigns. Requests outside the agreed scope or revision count
        may be quoted and billed separately.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold text-brandRed">4. Payments</h2>
      <p>
        Payment terms (including any deposits, milestones, or due dates) will be specified in your proposal or invoice.
        Work may pause if invoices are overdue. Digital deliverables may be withheld until payment has been received.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold text-brandRed">5. Ownership & Usage</h2>
      <p>
        After full payment is received, you receive a license to use the final, approved deliverables for your own business
        or personal use, as described in your project scope. Elevated AI Works retains the right to display non-confidential
        work in portfolios, case studies, and marketing materials unless you request otherwise in writing.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold text-brandRed">6. Client Responsibilities</h2>
      <p>
        You are responsible for:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1">
        <li>Providing accurate and lawful content, information, and instructions.</li>
        <li>Ensuring you have rights to any materials you supply (such as logos, photos, or copy).</li>
        <li>Reviewing and approving work before it is published or put into use.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold text-brandRed">7. No Legal, Financial, or Medical Advice</h2>
      <p>
        While some tools or templates may touch on planning, budgeting, or documentation, Elevated AI Works does not
        provide legal, financial, medical, or other professional advice. Any materials are for general informational
        and organizational purposes only.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold text-brandRed">8. Limitation of Liability</h2>
      <p>
        To the fullest extent permitted by law, Elevated AI Works is not liable for any indirect, incidental, or consequential
        damages arising from the use of our Services or deliverables. Our total liability in connection with any project
        is limited to the amount you paid for that specific project.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold text-brandRed">9. Cancellations</h2>
      <p>
        If you choose to cancel a project after work has begun, any non-refundable deposit and fees for work already completed
        will remain due. Details on refunds are described in the Refund &amp; Revision Policy.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold text-brandRed">10. Changes to These Terms</h2>
      <p>
        These Terms may be updated from time to time. The “Last updated” date at the top of this page will reflect the
        most recent version. Continued use of the Services after changes are posted indicates acceptance of the updated Terms.
