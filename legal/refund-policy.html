            This policy explains how Elevated AI Works handles deposits, revisions, cancellations, and refund requests for custom work.

          <article class="card glass-card legal-card legal-content">
            <h2>Deposits &amp; Payment Structure</h2>
            <p>Most projects require an upfront deposit before work begins. The exact amount or percentage will be outlined in your proposal or agreement. Deposits are generally non-refundable once work has started, as time and resources are committed to your project.</p>
            <p>Remaining balances are typically due at agreed milestones or upon delivery of final files, depending on the scope of the project.</p>
          </article>

          <article class="card glass-card legal-card legal-content">
            <h2>Included Revisions</h2>
            <p>Each project includes a defined number of revision rounds, which will be clearly stated in your proposal or project summary. A “revision round” generally means a batch of requested changes reviewed at one time, not an unlimited number of continuous edits.</p>
            <p>The goal is to refine the work in a structured way—moving from rough drafts to polished deliverables, while keeping the project within the estimated timeline and budget.</p>
          </article>

          <article class="card glass-card legal-card legal-content">
            <h2>Out-of-Scope Changes</h2>
            <p>If you request changes that significantly alter the original direction, scope, or complexity of the project (for example, a full redesign after approval of a concept), these may be treated as additional work.</p>
            <p>When that happens, Elevated AI Works will discuss options with you, which may include:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Adjusting the scope and timeline</li>
              <li>Adding an additional fee for the new work</li>
              <li>Splitting the new request into a separate project</li>
            </ul>
          </article>

          <article class="card glass-card legal-card legal-content">
            <h2>Cancellations</h2>
            <p>If you decide to cancel a project after work has begun, you will be responsible for the portion of work already completed up to the cancellation date. In most cases, this means:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>The initial deposit is retained to cover time and resources already invested</li>
              <li>Any additional work beyond the deposit value may be invoiced on a prorated basis</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If Elevated AI Works must cancel a project for any reason, reasonable efforts will be made to provide a partial refund or deliver usable work-in-progress files, depending on the situation.</p>
          </article>

          <article class="card glass-card legal-card legal-content">
            <h2>Refund Requests</h2>
            <p>Because custom work is time-based and tailored to your request, full refunds are not typically available once work has started. However, Elevated AI Works understands that situations can change.</p>
            <p>If you believe there is a clear issue with the work delivered (for example, it does not align with the agreed scope), please reach out as soon as possible. The first step will always be:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Clarifying the concern</li>
              <li>Reviewing the agreed scope and references</li>
              <li>Attempting to resolve the issue through revisions</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In rare cases, a partial refund or credit toward future work may be offered at the discretion of Elevated AI Works, especially if a project is ended early or cannot be completed as planned.</p>
          </article>

          <article class="card glass-card legal-card legal-content">
            <h2>Digital Files &amp; Final Delivery</h2>
            <p>Once final files have been delivered and approved (for example, logo files, website exports, documents, or templates), refunds are generally not available. You are encouraged to review drafts and proofs carefully before final approval so that any issues can be addressed during the revision stage.</p>
          </article>

          <article class="card glass-card legal-card legal-content">
            <h2>Communication &amp; Response Times</h2>
            <p>Timely feedback and communication help keep projects moving smoothly. If there are long gaps in communication or delayed approvals, timelines may need to be adjusted. In some cases, a paused project may be considered complete if there is no response for an extended period, even if all revisions were not used.</p>
          </article>

          <article class="card glass-card legal-card legal-content">
            <h2>Questions</h2>
            <p>If you have questions about how this Refund &amp; Revision Policy applies to your project, please reach out through the <a class="work-link" href="../contact.html">contact page</a> before starting.</p>
