            <h2>1. Scope of Work</h2>
            <p>Every project begins with a defined scope of work, usually in the form of a written proposal, estimate, or project summary. This document will describe deliverables, timelines, and pricing to the best of our ability based on the information available at the time.</p>
            <p>The scope may include (for example): branding assets, website pages, AI workflows, automations, strategy documents, or other creative and technical services.</p>
            <p>If you ask for changes that go beyond the agreed scope, we may need to revise the timeline and pricing or treat the new requests as a separate project.</p>
          </article>

          <article class="card glass-card legal-card legal-content">
            <h2>2. Client Responsibilities</h2>
            <p>To keep projects moving smoothly, we rely on you to:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Provide accurate and timely information about your business, goals, and preferences</li>
              <li>Share any required assets (such as logos, brand guides, copy, or images) you already have</li>
              <li>Review proofs and drafts within a reasonable time frame</li>
              <li>Communicate changes clearly so revisions can be handled efficiently</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Delays in providing content or feedback may impact the project timeline and completion date.</p>
          </article>

          <article class="card glass-card legal-card legal-content">
            <h2>3. Payments &amp; Deposits</h2>
            <p>Unless otherwise stated, projects require a deposit before work begins. The remaining balance is due on agreed milestones or when final deliverables are completed.</p>
            <p>All invoices are payable in the currency and by the methods stated on the invoice. Late or missed payments may pause project work until the account is current.</p>
            <p>For details about deposits, cancellations, and refunds, please refer to the <a class="work-link" href="refund-policy.html">Refund &amp; Revision Policy</a>.</p>

          <article class="card glass-card legal-card legal-content">
            <h2>4. Revisions &amp; Changes</h2>
            <p>Most projects include a specific number of revision rounds, as stated in your proposal or scope. Revisions are opportunities to refine designs, copy, or functionality based on your feedback.</p>
            <p>Substantial changes in direction after a concept has been approved—or requests that add significant new features—may be considered out of scope and subject to additional fees or timeline changes.</p>

          <article class="card glass-card legal-card legal-content">
            <h2>5. Intellectual Property</h2>
            <p>Unless otherwise agreed in writing:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Final deliverables that have been fully paid for are typically licensed or assigned to you for use in your business.</li>
              <li>Preliminary concepts, unused designs, internal tools, and working files remain the property of Elevated AI Works.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You are responsible for ensuring that any content, images, or materials you provide do not infringe upon the rights of others. Elevated AI Works is not responsible for legal issues arising from materials you supply.</p>

            <h2>6. Use of AI Tools &amp; Automation</h2>
            <p>Elevated AI Works may use AI tools and automation as part of the creative or technical process—for example, to generate drafts, explore variations, or assist with code and documentation.</p>
            <p>All AI-assisted work is guided and reviewed by a human before delivery, but AI outputs may contain limitations or inaccuracies. You agree to review deliverables carefully and use your own judgment when applying them to your business.</p>

          <article class="card glass-card legal-card legal-content">
            <h2>7. Timelines &amp; Delays</h2>
            <p>Project timelines are estimates based on the agreed scope and reasonable cooperation from both sides. We will communicate if we foresee delays and appreciate the same from you.</p>
            <p>Elevated AI Works is not responsible for delays caused by factors outside our control, including late feedback, missing content, third-party outages, or major technical issues with external platforms.</p>

          <article class="card glass-card legal-card legal-content">
            <h2>8. Third-Party Services &amp; Integrations</h2>
            <p>Some projects may involve third-party tools or platforms (for example: hosting, domain registrars, analytics, email services, or AI providers). Where possible, these accounts will be created in your name so you can retain ownership and control.</p>
            <p>Elevated AI Works is not responsible for changes made by third-party providers, such as pricing changes, feature removals, outages, or policy updates. Your use of third-party services is subject to their respective terms and privacy policies.</p>

            <h2>9. Limitation of Liability</h2>
            <p>To the fullest extent permitted by law, Elevated AI Works is not liable for any indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages, or for any loss of profits, revenue, data, or business opportunities arising from your use of our services or deliverables.</p>
            <p>In any case where liability is found, it will be limited to the total amount you have paid for the specific project giving rise to the claim.</p>

            <h2>10. Termination</h2>
            <p>Either party may end a project if the other party materially breaches these terms and does not resolve the issue within a reasonable time after being notified.</p>
            <p>If a project is ended early, you will be responsible for paying for the portion of work completed up to the termination date, as outlined in the Refund &amp; Revision Policy.</p>

          <article class="card glass-card legal-card legal-content">
            <h2>11. Changes to These Terms</h2>
